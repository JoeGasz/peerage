## Add your protectorate to the map

There are two ways to have your protectorate added to the map:

1. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/NoAgenda/peerage/issues/new)
2. Email [peerage@noagendahr.org](mailto:peerage@noagendahr.org)

Make sure to include the following info:

1. Your name and title
2. The location of your protectorate
3. A link to the segment of the show on [No Agenda Player](https://www.noagendaplayer.com) for proof

Providing a map of your protectorate is always helpful to make sure that itâ€™s
correct.
